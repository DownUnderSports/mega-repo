Down Under Sports was founded in 1989, based on the dream of two New Zealanders named George and Shelley O'Scanlon. They fell in love with athletics, especially American football (gridiron). Their dream was to promote football in Australia and New Zealand. In 1979, George founded the New Zealand American Football Association (NZAFA). This was the first time that American Football was played in the Pacific! In 1989, they began inviting American high school football players to compete in New Zealand and Australia. Over the years, this tournament, which was given the name "The Down Under Bowl", started to see overwhelming success.

We saw this as an exciting opportunity to include other young athletes in this fun and rewarding experience. Over the last three decades, Down Under Sports has shared the land down under with thousands of athletes from all across the United States! No matter the sport, the goal has been the same; to use the common language of sports to bridge the continents. Through Down Under Sports, countless friendships and memories have been made.
