The Australian borders remain closed due to COVID-19 and are currently not
scheduled to reopen to foreign travelers until 2021. We hoped to return to
normal operations next month; unfortunately, our office hours will likely have
to remain limited for the remainder of the year while the world is eagerly
awaiting a vaccine. We apologize about the lack of customer service; however,
this will allow us to minimize our expenses until it is safe to continue our
regular business operations.

Our office hours will continue to fluctuate as we follow local, state, and
federal health recommendations and ordinances. Please feel free to email or text
us and we will respond as quickly as possible.

We also put together a short video explaining things at:
