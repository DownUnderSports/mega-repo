Our office will continue to have limited hours this summer, but you are welcome
to email us or leave a message; we will respond as we are able to and aim to
resume normal operations this fall.

We understand that the current climate is not favorable for fundraising efforts
and will therefore wait to send your 2021 fundraising materials until a more
appropriate time.

We hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy through these
unprecedented times.

Sincerely,
