G'day!

We are getting your 2021 fundraising information ready to send out this month.
We want you to have plenty of time to prepare for your trip next summer. Please
see our June newsletter attached to read a fundraising success story from one
of our athletes from West Virginia.

Be sure to check your state health and safety guidelines before resuming any
fundraising activities.

Cheers,
