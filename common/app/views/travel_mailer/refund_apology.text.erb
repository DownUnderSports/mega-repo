Kia Ora,

In the winter of 2018-19, our founders George and Shelley O'Scanlon passed away
tragically. It was through their dream and hard work that Down Under Sports has
shared the land down under with athletes from all across the United States.

Although we were devastated by their loss, it has been our goal to keep George
and Shelley's dream alive. This international crisis has certainly reinforced
the importance of family and tradition. Whether it be health-wise or
economically, it is likely that you or someone you love has been directly
affected by the pandemic; our staff and families are no exception. We extend our
deepest apologies for the time it has taken to deal with these unprecedented
situations and to find workable solutions for our cancelled travelers. Please
keep in mind that many of the costs associated with this program are incurred
prior to and throughout the regular course of business.

As such, we will begin processing cancellations according to our refund policy,
which includes a non-refundable deposit and travel insurance premium (for those
who opted into the Travelex plan). If you are owed a refund, you will receive a
separate email in the coming weeks with specifics on the amount and expected
date to receive the funds. Please respond to that email if you wish to select
one of the other account options presented to you in May.

We wish you and your families all the best.

Sincerely,

The O'Scanlon Family
