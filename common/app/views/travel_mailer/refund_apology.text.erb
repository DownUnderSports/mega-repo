Kia Ora,

In the winter of 2018-19, our founders, George and Shelley O'Scanlon, passed away tragically. It was through their dream and hard work that Down Under Sports has shared the land down under with athletes from all across the United States for over 30 years.

Although we are still grieving their loss, it is our goal to keep George and Shelley's dream alive. The world-wide COVID-19 pandemic has certainly reinforced the importance of family, tradition, and community. Whether it be health-wise or economically, it is likely that you or someone you love has been directly affected by the pandemic or the current political climate; our staff and families are no exception. The undeniable reality is that nothing we could have done as a company could have prevented the Australian government from ordering the border closed to foreign travelers. The company cannot immediately refund cancelled travelers because many of the costs associated with this program are incurred prior to each year's travel. Our staff and vendors have already been paid for their work in preparing for this year's tournaments.

Accordingly, Down Under Sports cannot refund monies to cancelled travelers unless and until normal operations resume. Since we have postponed our 2020 tournaments, our operations are essentially on hold until we can begin our regular recruiting which is unlikely to resume until January 2021 at the earliest. We understand the hardships that this causes, and we are suffering alongside you, with many of our staff and employees having been terminated or furloughed. This is a small, family-run sports travel business that has been devastated by the very sudden and ongoing lockdowns and travel restrictions. We are heart-broken at the possibility of seeing George and Shelley's legacy so quickly destroyed after their passing and due entirely to factors out of our control.

We extend our deepest apologies for the time it will take to deal with these unprecedented situations we find ourselves in. We wish you and your families all the best during these difficult times. We hope that you will do the same for ours and allow us the time we need to rebuild this amazing company and keep our founders' dream alive.

Sincerely,

- Down Under Sports
