Hi <%= @user.print_first_name_only %>,

Below you will find an accounting of the funds submitted to Down Under Sports (as of <%= pretty_date_text Date.today %>), as well as a link to your statement.
<% if @refundable_amount > 0 %>

Our office will continue to have limited availability throughout the summer due to our 2020 tours being postponed. Normal operations must resume in order for Down Under Sports to begin refunding monies owed to cancelled travelers.

We understand that this is not ideal; however, we are committed to getting you the total refundable amount in a timely fashion and in a way that allows us to continue operations and pay our employees as well as provide this once in a lifetime experience to our participants next summer.
<% end %>

Cheers!
