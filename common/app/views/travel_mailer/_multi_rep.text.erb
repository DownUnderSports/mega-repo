Our office will have limited availability throughout the month of April while our communities address COVID-19. We are in the process of contacting all of our 2020 participants. If you are unable to reach us, please leave a message or send us an email and we will get back to you as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

We want to introduce <%= (@sport.rep[:reps].map{|rep| rep[:name] }).join(" and ") %> as the designated representatives for our <%= @sport.full.downcase %> program. Please direct any questions/concerns you have about your account to them. You can contact <%= (@sport.rep[:reps].map{|rep| "#{rep[:name]} at #{rep[:phone]} or #{rep[:email]}" }).join(", and ") %>. If you have not done so already, please discontinue any fundraising activities for the time being while our communities address COVID-19.
