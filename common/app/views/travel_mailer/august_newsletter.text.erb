G'day!

We are looking forward to hosting you next summer! Australia is forecasting
opening its borders to tourism in early 2021, which is very good news for our
travelers and the international community as we anticipate a COVID-19 vaccine.

At Down Under Sports, the well-being of our participants has been and always
will be our #1 priority, and we are currently working on a travel insurance
policy to offer you for next year. It is important that we wait to finalize
travel insurance arrangements before updating you with fundraising materials for
2021. We will get your fundraising packet sent to you just as soon as possible.

Our office hours are still limited and will continue to fluctuate as we follow
local, state, and federal health recommendations and ordinances. Please feel
free to email or text us and we will respond as quickly as possible.

We also put together a short video explaining things at:

Check out the attached newsletter for a chance to learn a little more about
Australia!

Cheers!
