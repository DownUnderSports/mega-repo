G'day!

Australia is forecasting opening its borders to tourism in early 2021, which is
very good news for our travelers and the international community as we
anticipate a COVID-19 vaccine. When it is safe to resume normal operations and
we have confirmation that US travelers will be allowed entry into other
countries, we will send out more detailed information on the 2021 tours.

Our office hours will continue to fluctuate in the immediate future as we follow
local, state, and federal health recommendations and ordinances. Please feel
free to email or text us and we will respond as quickly as possible.

We also put together a short video explaining things at:

Check out the attached newsletter for a chance to learn a little more about
Australia!

Cheers!
