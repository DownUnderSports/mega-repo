An Update on Your Cancellation Request for <%= @user.print_names %> (<%= @user.dus_id %>)

Our office will have limited availability throughout the month of April while our communities address COVID-19.

We appreciate your patience as we are working on a solution for our travelers who are unable to transfer to 2021. We would like to extend a warm thank you to the many athletes, parents, and coaches that have been understanding and kind throughout this process.

Sincerely

- Down Under Sports
