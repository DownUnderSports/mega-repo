G'Day!

It was an incredible honor hosting the Down Under Sports Tournaments this summer! Our goal is to provide every participant with the experience of a lifetime traveling and competing in Australia.

To meet our goal, we need you to let us know what we did right and what we can improve on. Did you have a favorite or least favorite part of the trip? Now you can let us know! Was there a coach, tour guide, or staff member who did an extraordinary job? This is your chance to recognize them!

Please visit the link below to give us your feedback. The survey should take less than 10 minutes.
