Over the last three decades, Down Under Sports has shared the land down
under with thousands of athletes from all across the United States!

Through Down Under Sports, countless friendships and memories have been
made. While we are disappointed that we can’t provide this once in a
lifetime opportunity in 2020, we can’t wait to carry on this wonderful
tradition and keep our founders' dream alive!

Cheers,
