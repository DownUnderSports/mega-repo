        G'day!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the winter of 2018-19, our founders George and Shelley O'Scanlon passed away tragically. It was through their dream and hard work that Down Under Sports has shared the land down under with athletes from all across the United States, and it has been our goal to keep George and Shelleyâ€™s dream alive; including during this international crisis.

        Whether it be healthwise or economically, it's likely that you or someone you love has been directly affected by this pandemic; our staff and families are no exception. Please accept our deepest apologies for the time it has taken to deal with this unprecedented situation. We will begin processing refunds according to our refund policy, which includes a non-refundable deposit and travel insurance premium (for those who opted into the Travelex plan). Many of the costs associated with this program are incurred prior to and throughout the regular course of business.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are owed a refund, you will receive a separate email with specifics on your refund amount and expected date. Please respond to that email if you wish to select one of the other account options presented to you in May.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wish you all the best in your future endeavors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sincerely,
      </p>
      <p>
        The O'Scanlon Family
