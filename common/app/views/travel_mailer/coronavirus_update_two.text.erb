Down Under Sports Travel Update

On March 19, the Prime Minister of Australia announced a travel ban on all non-residents and non-Australian citizens entering Australia. This is the first time in the company's 31 year history that the tournaments have been unable to proceed. We are a small, family-operated business and we appreciate your patience as we navigate this unprecedented situation. We will reach out to all of our 2020 travelers in the upcoming weeks to review options going forward.

Best Wishes,
