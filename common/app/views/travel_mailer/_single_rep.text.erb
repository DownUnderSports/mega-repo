Our office will have limited availability throughout the month of April while our communities address COVID-19. We are in the process of contacting all of our 2020 participants. If you are unable to reach us, please leave a message or send us an email and we will get back to you as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

We want to introduce <%= @sport.rep[:name] %> as the designated representative for our <%= @sport.full.downcase %> program. Please direct any questions/concerns you have about your account to <%= @sport.rep[:name] %>. You can contact <%= @sport.rep[:him_her] %> at <%= @sport.rep[:phone] %> or <%= @sport.rep[:email] %>. If you have not done so already, please discontinue any fundraising activities for the time being while our communities address COVID-19.
