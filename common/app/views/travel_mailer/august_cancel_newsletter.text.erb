All of our 2020 registered participants were given the option of deferring their
travel to our 2021 tournaments or cancelling their trip and selecting from one
of five cancellation choices, including requesting a refund. As soon as the
Australian government closed its borders in March, we asked all participants to
cease any and all fundraising activities which put a stop to all incoming funds
from participants transferring to 2021; funds needed for issuing refunds and
operating the business.

The Australian border remains closed due to COVID-19 and is currently not
scheduled to reopen to foreign travelers until 2021. We hoped to return to
normal operations this month; unfortunately, our office hours will likely have
to remain limited for the remainder of the year while the world is eagerly
awaiting a vaccine. We apologize about the lack of customer service; however,
this will allow us to minimize our expenses until it is practical to continue
our regular business operations. The only way for us to feasibly refund our
cancelled 2020 travelers is to resume taking payments and recruit new
participants to join the 2021 tournaments; however, we are unable to do that
until we know that US travelers will be allowed entry into other countries.

Please be aware that participants who choose to request a refund will have to
continue to wait a while due to the complexities of postponing our 2020 events
and the current lack of available funds. It will likely take years for the US
and the world to recover from the enormous economic impact of COVID-19. Our
small, family business is no exception to that and we appreciate everyone that
has been understanding of the devastating effect that this has had on our staff
and company. Like most companies in the travel industry, we have already
drastically reduced our workforce and changed up our business model in order to
accommodate for the decreased demand in tourism. The good news is that many of
our 2020 participants opted to defer to 2021, allowing us to cut down on
recruiting costs we would normally incur at this time of year. If we are able to
resume normal operations by the beginning of 2021, then we are still on track to
host our 2021 tournaments as planned and can pick up where we left off back in
March. If we are unable to continue ongoing limited operations due to aggressive
refund tactics taken by our cancelled travelers, we will be forced into a
bankruptcy that will negatively impact everyone. 

Our office hours will continue to fluctuate as we follow local, state, and
federal health recommendations and ordinances. Please feel free to email or text
us and we will respond as quickly as possible.

We also put together a short video explaining things at:
