We have started to reach out to our travelers; however, it will take some time to get through to everyone. Throughout all of this, we also need to allow our staff time to take care of themselves and their families.

Each of our intended 2020 travelers will be contacted in the upcoming weeks, including our coaches and officials. You do not need to contact us first. Please allow our staff time to get caught up and work through their assigned lists.

Thank you for your patience.
