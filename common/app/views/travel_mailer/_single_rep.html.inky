      We want to introduce <%= @sport.rep[:name] %> as the designated representative for our <%= @sport.full.downcase %> program. Please direct any questions/concerns you have about your account to <%= @sport.rep[:name] %>. You can contact <%= @sport.rep[:him_her] %> at <a href="tel:<%= @sport.rep[:phone] %>"><%= @sport.rep[:phone] %></a> or <a href="tel:<%= @sport.rep[:email] %>"><%= @sport.rep[:email] %></a>. If you have not done so already, please discontinue any fundraising activities for the time being while our communities address COVID-19.
