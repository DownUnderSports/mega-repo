Thank you for your interest in Down Under Sports!


G'day!

Thank you for requesting information on the Down Under Sports Tournaments! Over the past 31 years, we've had over 55,000 participants travel with us to the land down under.

Please take a moment to view our information video where we will cover pricing, fundraising opportunities, and available discounts for the competition.

We are always on the look out for talented new athletes. If you coach any athletes that you think would make a strong competitor in our program, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Cheers!
