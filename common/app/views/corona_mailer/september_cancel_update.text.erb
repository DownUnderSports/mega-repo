September Update
########################################

The Australian border remains closed due to COVID-19 and is currently not scheduled to reopen to foreign travelers until 2021. We hoped to return to normal operations this month; unfortunately, our office hours will likely have to remain limited for the remainder of the year while the world is eagerly awaiting a vaccine. We apologize about the lack of customer service; however, this will allow us to minimize our expenses until it is practical to continue our regular business operations.

Our office hours will continue to fluctuate as we follow local, state, and federal health recommendations and ordinances. Please feel free to email or text us and we will respond as quickly as possible.

Sincerely,
