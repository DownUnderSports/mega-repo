G'Day!

Thank you for your continued support of the Down Under Sports program. We are diligently working to make sure that everything you need for the 2021 tours is prepped and ready to go.

We know many of our participants have questions and concerns with regards to raising funds needed to pay for their trip next year given the current state of affairs with the coronavirus and travel restrictions. We feel it is best not to start directly fundraising until we know that travel bans will be lifted and that our participants will be allowed entry into Australia.

However, we know that it is also important to have as much time to fundraise as possible in order to make your trip a reality. As such, Down Under Sports is offering our time-tested t-shirt fundraiser to you now. Down Under Sports will collect and fulfill all submitted orders on a weekly basis; orders will be shipped out each Wednesday.

We encourage you to use this fundraiser as a way to help local charities of your choosing or to continue your fundraising for next summer. If your are fundraising for your trip, we ask that you do not submit funds into your account at this point in time. Please set aside any profit earned from you t-shirt sales in cashiers checks or money orders which you can submit at a later date.

For you to legally participate in these fundraising activities, and to protect your NCAA eligibility, it is important that you do not deposit any funds raised into a personal account.

We extend our deepest apologies for the time it will take to deal with these unprecedented situations we find ourselves in. We wish you and your families all the best during these difficult times. Our office hours will still vary for the immediate future, and we also apologize again for the interruption in customer service; if you need to reach us please don't hesitate to send us an email or leave us a message.

With Gratitude,
