Fundraising In Our Current Climate

G'Day!

Thank you for your continued support of the Down Under Sports program.

We know many of our participants have questions and concerns with regards to their trip next year given the current state of affairs with the coronavirus and travel restrictions. We share those concerns and feel it is best not to start receiving donations directly for your trip until we know that travel bans will be lifted and that US travelers will be allowed entry into Australia next summer.

We are hopeful this will be confirmed by the end of the year and are diligently working to make sure that everything you need for the 2021 program is prepped and ready to go. We know how important it is to have as much time to fundraise as possible in order to make your trip a reality; however, the only fundraiser that we feel comfortable allowing at this time is t-shirt sales. We will fulfill all submitted orders on a weekly basis and only collect the money for the cost of your t-shirt order. This fundraiser not only helps our company while regular operations are on hold, it can also be used as a way to help local charities of your choosing.

We wish you and your families all the best during these difficult times. If you need to reach us please don't hesitate to send us an email or leave us a message.

With Gratitude,
