G'day!

We apologize about the interruption in customer service as we are following state and national COVID-19 guidelines. We will still have limited availability for at least the first half of May as we start to bring staff back and get everyone caught up, while staying safe and continuing to follow health and safety guidelines.

<%= yield :selection_message %>

    1. I would like to participate in the 2021 tournaments as an athlete, coach's assistant, supporter, or another role (depending on eligibility). Please roll my account over for the 2021 program.

    2. I would like to use the funds in my account as a travel credit. Please send me a list of options available.

    3. I would like to donate the funds in my account to go toward a 2021 athlete. I would like to nominate the athlete of my choice (please provide us the name of the athlete) or please select an athlete on my behalf.

    4. I would like to apply the funds in my account to someone who wants to travel in my place. Please send me the information to switch over my account.

    5. I would like to completely cancel my trip. Please finish processing my cancellation.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we address each of our travelers during these unprecedented times. If other options become available, we will continue to provide you updates and information.
