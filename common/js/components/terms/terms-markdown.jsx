Participant includes the Athletes, who are participating and/or competing in the sporting events and competitions, as well as any family or friends ("Supporters") who may also travel with and thereby also participate in the DUS Program with the Athlete. These Terms and Conditions also apply to and are binding on any and all legal guardians of any Participants who are minors or infants. Payment of a deposit or other participation in the DUS Program is considered a consent by the Participant and/or, as noted, by the Participant's legal guardian, to these Terms and Conditions.


3. ##### DUS Program Costs <a id="dus-program-costs"></a>
  The DUS Program Costs for Participants are determined based upon applicable vendors or carriers' rules, regulations, fares, prices and US dollar exchange rates in effect on June 1st of the previous year and are subject to change if such rates or costs change. The DUS Program Costs are also subject to increases due to unforeseen fuel surcharges, government taxes, fees or other assessments. Upon learning of such, DUS will notify you of any changes in the DUS Program Costs as soon as reasonably possible.


4. ##### Deposits and Payments <a id="dus-program-costs"></a>
  Each Participant in the DUS Program must complete an Application. Applications to travel with and/or participate in the DUS Program will be considered on a first-come, first-served basis. Each applicant must submit a required and non-refundable $300 deposit with an Application. This deposit is non-refundable and non-transferable unless stated otherwise in Section 10. The deposit will be applied to the DUS Program Costs. Payments towards the DUS Program Costs are required according to the payment schedule provided by DUS ("Payment Schedule"). Late fees may be incurred if payments and final balances due are received after the due dates established in the Payment Schedule. DUS reserves the right to refuse acceptance or participation in the DUS Program and to remove a Participant from the DUS Program for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, at any time.


5. ##### DUS Program Inclusions <a id="dus-program-inclusions"></a>
    1. Air Transportation
        1. International Flights
          The DUS Program includes roundtrip international airfare from a designated airport ("International Gateway") to Brisbane, AU. The International Gateway is determined by DUS. Typically, Los Angeles, CA is the International Gateway, however, an alternate International Gateway airport may be used in the sole discretion of DUS.
          If a Participant decides to purchase his/her own flight and/or transportation to or lodging in Brisbane, AU, DUS shall not be responsible for any of a Participant's travel or lodging coordination, including if a Participant purchases tickets for the wrong date/time/location. Any fees incurred for this purpose shall be and remain the sole responsibility of each Participant. A Participant will also be responsible for the transportation between the Australian airport and hotel. An itinerary and flight schedule for flights that a Participant arranges must be provided to DUS by no later than June 1 of the travel year.
        2. Domestic Flights
          Each Participant will automatically be assigned a roundtrip domestic airfare to the International Gateway through DUS. The beginning airport or "Point of Origin Airport" will be designated by DUS. DUS will do its best to designate the closest available airport to a Participant's disclosed residence. Participants will be scheduled on domestic flights with coaches and/or other athletes when possible; however, the majority of Participants will travel alone from their Point of Origin Airport to the International Gateway, where groups will board the flight to Australia. To help ensure that no Participants miss their connections at the International Gateway, DUS has a standard policy of a 4 to 8 hour layover at the International Gateway (i.e., Participants should plan for downtime accordingly).
        3. Opting Out of Domestic Flights and Associated Waiver
          To opt out of DUS booking a domestic roundtrip flight on behalf of a Participant, Participant must provide direct, written notice to DUS within 30 days of paying the deposit. Opting out on the Participant's account on the DUS website will satisfy this notice requirement. If a Participant chooses to opt out of the domestic flight option, the Participant will be fully responsible for arranging transportation to/from the International Gateway, assumes all responsibility for timely arrival for the scheduled international flight, and will remain fully responsible for any complications that may arise as a consequence of arranging said transportation outside of DUS.
        4. Benefits of Booking Domestic Airfare through DUS
          The benefits of booking domestic airfare through DUS include:
            1. Participant's account will not be charged an upfront ticket price, allowing Participant time to fundraise for this cost.
            2. DUS will coordinate Participant's domestic flight with other team members where possible.
            3. Participant will be allowed two (2) checked bags for the duration of the trip (50 lb weight limit per bag).
            4. Participant's checked bags will continue checked through to the final destination of Brisbane, Australia, avoiding a reclaim and recheck process at the International Gateway.
            5. Participant will be eligible for DUS 24/7 travel assistance for missed/delayed/cancelled flights.
            6. If Participant is covered by Travelex insurance (discussed below), Participant's trip will be covered roundtrip from the Point of Origin Airport (i.e., Participant's trip is only covered to/from International Gateway, if Participant opts out of DUS providing domestic airfare).
        5. Final Flight Details
          DUS cannot confirm final travel and flight details until April 15 of the travel year. School holidays and other considerations are used to allocate departure dates for each group. Each Participant will be notified of his/her group's departure date.
        6. Changes to Flight Schedules
          Within 30 days of paying the deposit, a Participant may submit a written request to DUS to change the Point of Origin Airport, including through Participant's account on the DUS website. DUS will do its best to accommodate requested changes, but cannot guarantee such will be made. Requests for flight changes from the scheduled flight itinerary made after 30 days of paying the deposit must be in writing and sent to DUS by April 1 of the travel year. For each change accommodated, DUS will charge a $250 change fee, which is in addition to any additional cost in airfare (i.e., due to changes in rates, etc.).
    2. Ground Transportation and Transfers
      All ground transportation provided during the trip will be by modern, climate controlled motor coaches. All transfers for the scheduled DUS Program events are included. However, even if a Participant booked his/her domestic and international flights through DUS, each Participant is responsible for transportation to and from the Point of Origin Airport. Transportation to and from destinations not in the scheduled DUS Program group itinerary shall remain the sole responsibility of Participant.
    3. Baggage
      Participants are responsible for handling their own luggage. Luggage will be limited to one carry-on and two checked pieces. Checked luggage may not exceed 50 lbs (fees may be incurred for overweight baggage). As certain airlines may charge additional baggage related fees, such fees shall remain the sole responsibility of Participant.
    4. Accommodations
      Hotel accommodations for shared rooms are provided as part of the DUS Program. Each participant will have their own bed (i.e., a standard, or rollaway bed). All Participants will be assigned double occupancy rooms. There are limited numbers of single rooms available for Supporters at an additional cost. The accommodation properties will be listed in the ground itinerary provided to the Participant. The accommodation property may be changed, but any substitute will be roughly equivalent to the listed accommodation property.
    5. Meals
      Two meals per day will be provided throughout the DUS Program beginning with arrival in Australia and ending upon departure from Australia. Any additional meals, snacks or food will remain the responsibility of the Participant.
    6. Tips and Taxes

      Various tours and events will be provided to Participant as part of the DUS Program. Some are included in the DUS Program Costs as outlined in the itinerary of events provided by DUS.

This tour has limited availability and will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis. Full cost for the tour must be paid at the designated sign-up time in order to reserve the Participant's spot. The reservation of the Participant's spot is non-transferable and a cancellation is non-refundable.
    9. Itinerary Changes
      DUS plans each DUS Program itinerary and all features a year in advance for the advantage, convenience and enjoyment of the Participant. DUS reserves the right to change or vary its itinerary. In such circumstance, DUS will do its best to provide the best available alternative substitute.
    10. Fundraising
      A company affiliated with DUS provides fundraising opportunities to help Athletes pay for the DUS Program. DUS and affiliated companies are committed to complying with all required federal non-profit and NCAA regulations. Accordingly, all funds raised by Participant through Dreamtime Foundation must be submitted to DUS every 2 weeks. No fundraised money is allowed to be kept by any Participant. Fundraising checks must be made payable to Down Under Sports and must not be deposited into a Participant or other person's bank account. Failure to follow this rule may interfere with high school or collegiate athletic eligibility as outlined by state and local high school sport regulations. Each Participant and applicable legal guardians are responsible for ensuring that all fundraising activities for any Participant comply with state and local laws and high school sport regulations (i.e., in each state wherein they fundraise). In the event of a cancellation, DUS will notify sponsors and all refundable, publicly raised funds must be returned to the source from which the funds were donated. If a Participant using a Dreamtime Foundation starter program is unable to participate in the DUS Program, community money that is raised will be used to help achieve the team's goal of competing in Australia. Participants are not to send cash in the mail.
