    Bio: () => <>Meet George and Shelley O&rsquo;Scanlon. They were the founders of Down Under Sports. George was raised in New Zealand. When George was young, he saw a documentary about football and fell in love. Back then, no one in New Zealand played, because football didn&rsquo;t exist in New Zealand. He dreamed of a day where football would be established in New Zealand, and became devoted to making that a reality. Sadly, George and Shelley have recently passed on, but Down Under Sports continues on in their memory to provide the experience of a lifetime.</>
